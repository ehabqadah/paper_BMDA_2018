\label{sec:concl}
In this paper, we presented a system that provides  a distributed pattern prediction over multiple large-scale event streams of moving objects(vessels). The system uses the event forecasting with Pattern Markov Chain (PMC) \cite{alevizos2017event} as base prediction model on each event stream, and it applies the protocol for distributed online prediction \cite{kamp2014communication} to exchange information between the models of multiple input event streams.  Our proposed system has been implemented using Apache Flink and Apache Kafka, and empirically tested against a large real-world event streams related to trajectories of moving vessels.
