\section{INTRODUCTION}


In recent years, the technological advances have led to a growing in the availability of massive amounts of continuous streaming data (i.e., data streams observing events) in many application domains such as social networks \cite{mathioudakis2010twittermonitor}, Internet of Things (IoT) \cite{miorandi2012internet}, and maritime surveillance \cite{patroumpas2015event}.  The ability to detect and predict the full matches of a pattern of interest (i.e., sequence of events within the event stream), defined by a domain expert, is important for several operational decision making tasks.
An event stream is an unbounded collection of timely ordered data observations in the form of an attribute tuple that is composed of a value from finite event types along with other categorical and numerical features. In this work we deal with movement event streams, for instance, in the context of maritime surveillance, event patterns prediction over real-time tracking streams of moving vessels is useful to alert maritime operation mangers about suspicious activities (e.g., fast sailing vessels near ports, or illegal fishing) before they happen. In this scenario, the event stream of a moving vessel consists of spatial-temporal and kinematic information along with the vessel's identification and its trajectory related events. However, processing real-time streaming data with low latency is challenging since data streams are large and distributed in nature and continuously keep on coming at a high rate.

\par In this paper, we present a design and implementation of an online, distributed and scalable pattern prediction system over multiple massive streams of events. More precisely we consider the event streams related to trajectories of moving objects (vessels). The proposed approach is based on a novel method that combines the distributed online prediction protocol \cite{dekel2012optimal,kamp2014communication} with the event forecasting with Pattern Markov Chain system \cite{alevizos2017event}, implemented on top of the Big Data framework for stream processing Apache Flink \cite{Flink}. We evaluate our proposed system over  real-word data streams of moving vessels, which are provided in the context of the datAcron project\footnote{\url{http://www.datacron-project.eu/}}.

\par The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the related work in Section ~\ref{sec:realred_work}. In Section ~\ref{sec:proposed_approach}, we describe the problem, our proposed approach, and system architecture. The implementation details of our system on top of Flink are presented in Section ~\ref{sec:impl} and the experimental results in Section ~\ref{sec:results}. We discuss future work and conclude in Section 6.
